# Technical Interview Questions

## Important Note:

Memorizing these answers is not enough. A good interviewer will be able to tell if you've just memorized stuff or whether you know what you're talking about. Most interviewers will ask one of these questions and then ask a follow up question based on your answer. Therefore, focus on understanding the questions and topics thoroughly.
