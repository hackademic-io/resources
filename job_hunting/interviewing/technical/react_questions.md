# React interview questions

1. **What is React and how can you best describe it?**
   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, like how web pages look and behave. It's great for making interactive and dynamic web applications.
2. **Difference between a functional component and a class component:**

   - Functional components are simple functions that accept props as arguments and return React elements. They are stateless and do not have access to lifecycle methods.
   - Class components are ES6 classes that extend **`React.Component`**. They can hold and manage local state, have access to lifecycle methods, and can be more suitable for complex logic.
   - Example of a functional component:

   ```jsx
   jsxCopy code
   const FunctionalComponent = (props) => {
       return <div>{props.message}</div>;
   };

   ```

   - Example of a class component:

   ```jsx
   jsxCopy code
   class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
       render() {
           return <div>{this.props.message}</div>;
       }
   }

   ```

3. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX is a way to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. It helps make React code look like a mix of HTML and JavaScript, which makes building user interfaces easier.
4. **What is the virtual DOM and how is it used by React?**
   - The virtual DOM is like a blueprint of the real web page. React uses it to know what parts of the page need to change when something happens. This makes updating the page faster and more efficient.
5. **What are some of the advantages of using the virtual DOM?**
   - It makes updating the page faster because React only changes the parts that need to be changed, not the whole page. It also helps keep the code organized and easier to manage.
6. **What are some of the disadvantages of using the virtual DOM?**
   - It can use up more memory because it keeps a copy of the page in memory. Also, it might be a bit harder for beginners to understand at first.
7. **What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled inputs?**
   - Controlled inputs are like inputs that React manages, so when you type something, React knows about it. Uncontrolled inputs are more like regular HTML inputs where React doesn't keep track of what you type.
8. **What are some of the hooks commonly used in React?**
   - Some common hooks are **`useState`** for managing state, **`useEffect`** for doing things when the component loads or changes, and **`useContext`** for sharing data between components.
9. **When it comes to performance in React, what do you need to look out for?**

- You need to make sure your components don't re-render too often, avoid doing heavy calculations inside components, and try to keep your component tree simple and shallow.

10. **What is useMemo and how does it work?**

- **`useMemo`** is like a memo pad for calculations. It remembers the result of a calculation so you don't have to do it again every time your component re-renders.

11. **What is useCallback and how does it work?**
    - **`useCallback`** is like **`useMemo`**, but for functions. It remembers a function so it doesn't get recreated every time your component re-renders.
12. **What is useRef and how does it work? How does it differ from useState?**
    - **`useRef`** is like a reference to a DOM element or a value that doesn't change much. It's different from **`useState`** because it doesn't make your component re-render when it changes.
13. **What is Context and how does it work?**
    - Context is a way to share data between components without passing it through every component in between. It's useful for things like themes or user authentication.
14. **What is state management and when is it useful?**
    - State management is how you keep track of data in your application, like the current user or what's in a shopping cart. It's useful when you have lots of components that need to share the same data.
15. **What are some examples of state management libraries?**
    - Some examples are Redux, MobX, and Recoil. They help you manage state in big applications by providing tools and patterns to organize your data.
16. **What is the recommended way to structure your React code?**
    - The recommended way is to organize your code into small, reusable components and separate your concerns. This means keeping your UI, logic, and data separate to make your code easier to understand and maintain.
17. **What are some best practices for writing React code?**
    - Some best practices include keeping your components small and focused, using hooks instead of class components, and testing your code to make sure it works as expected.
18. **What are the React dev tools and what can you use them for?**
    - The React dev tools are like a magnifying glass for your React code. They help you inspect your components, track your component tree, and debug issues in your application.
19. **What is a good way to test your React applications?**
    - A good way is to write unit tests for your components and functions, integration tests to make sure your components work together, and end-to-end tests to simulate real user interactions. Testing helps you catch bugs early and make sure your code works as expected.
