# Tasks for Donovan

1. Build hackdemic website so I can stop losing my 20% cut to MentorCruise.
    - Unstructured mentorship - $250/mo to discuss anything you want relating to code. Best for people wanting to learn specific skills/technologies.
    - Job Hunting Help - $100/bi-weekly to do resume reviews, linkedin feedback, discuss interview strategies
    - Production grade project cohort. Give a description of the project and what we're building. This costs $650 for an 8 week guided course. To get you into production. Use production grade tools
    - FREE courses on easy concepts - git (commit ettiquette), resiliency (retries, pub sub, event driven architecture), rabbitMQ, writing good documentation, identifying crappy code (what your code looks like right now vs what it should look like)
    - PAID pdf/guide on free resources/tools and benchmarks. For self starters who just want an inside scoop to where they stand.
    - FREE community access. When you're learning it's nice to have people to learn with. No assholes though.
2. Create an email list (can have different kinds) - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathanbarry_every-professional-should-start-an-email-activity-7147658199255400448-3Rrm/
    - Tips for how to learn: work journals, read news (daily dev, hackernews), supplemental ed (videos, podcasts), doing things (projects), mastering your tools (postman, debugging, vscode), using chatGPT or a mentor (learn how to learn and ask precise questions), run isolated POCs (helpful to identify the root cause. could go into debugging)
3. Accountability System: Use Plaid to transfer money to me. I hold the money until you reach your goal. You have to have very specific measurable and attainable goals. Can be tied to one of my courses that I create. 
4. 


- Get stronger with golang
- Get better with Python - needed for any type of ML stuff
- Take Andrew Ng’s ML course
- Get better at algos so I don’t have to fear coding algorithms
- Improve on system design
- Hackademic stuff
- Improve Linux knowledge 
- 

Step 1 identify the stage you’re currently in.
- Should I get into software development? (Everything in here is free, just resources, articles, etc)
- Self taught/bootcamp grad. Learn bigger concepts: unit testing, integration testing, docker, deploying things to a VM. Working on bigger n more impressive things. 
- Actively applying to jobs. Different job boards. How to network n grow your LinkedIn. Meet ups and hackathons. Resume review.
- Actively interviewing. Leetcode, system design, behavioral, coding challenge feedback 
- Looking to level up. Event driven architecture. Scalability. Database replication, kubernetes. Ci/cd. Group projects 



How I structure mentorship

Articles to write:
- Improving your GitHub READMEs. And your GitHub profile README.
- Mastering your tools
    - Make better use of their IDEs. Make things easier on yourself
    - Debugging with VSCode, print statements, remote debugging with pdb
    - Using Docker to test stuff



Project Ideas:
- Selenium script to add a bunch of people on LinkedIn.
- Input a git url and follow this directory structure. And get a beautiful work journal. Create new entries on our site. Or push directly from GitHub.
- Website to showcase BEST bootcamp and self taught dev projects. This can be a vertical job board (charge companies to post jobs. Pay to be at the top)
- Heroku like app that takes care of deployments, CI, container registries. Make it super easy for a startup to come and pick the shit they want and just get a k8s cluster with all the stuff they need.
- Billing for AI companies. Create an API that consolidates API calls to LLMs. We can register and see how much they are using per request/user. And we just store that data in a database and let them view it. Could build a central API that consolidates the AI/LLMs or create an SDK. Or create proxy that sits at the network layer.
- Provide a better way of viewing LinkedIn posts. Provide sorting capabilities for it. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anjankaur_linkedin-organize-content-activity-7162413000828682241-jLF8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios
